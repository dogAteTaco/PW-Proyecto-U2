	<p><strong>Swain</strong> is a band I discovered through the magic of YouTube
		recommendations. The band went with the name This Routine is Hell for years, but decided to change their name
		along with their sound. TRIH was a hardcore punk-rock band but now they wanted to experiment with softer music
		and different styles. While I do like the TRIH albums I do admit they could get a little repetitive like most
		punk-rock bands so this experimenting was nice to see. So let&#8217;s talk about one of my favorite albums and
		the the band&#8217;s first album as Swain, <strong>The Long Dark Blue</strong>.</p>
	<p>As a whole, the album is about someone going through tough times, without a clear
		mind of what they want to do and in a way being too stuck to do those anything to achieve their goals. Musically
		speaking the style is a mix of good old grunge with some Weezer vibes on top of the hardcore punk style from
		their previous work. While some of some songs on the album may be very different than others, the heavily
		distorted guitar, thick bass tone and harsh vocals on the calmer songs make it blend pretty well with the harder
		songs, and those mellow slow songs prevent it from getting too stale.</p>
	<p>The album starts with “<strong>Hold My Head</strong>” and it doesn’t hold back
		anything. It has catchy vocal melodies, trashy guitars, simple but groovy drums, intense screaming with a nice
		background harmony; elements that will come back throughout the album. Like most of the other tracks, these
		lyrics are almost straight with their meaning; this one in particular is about having a shitty day and looking
		for some magic trick to fix this feeling. While short I think is my favorite track on the record just because it
		does everything that is great in this album perfectly.</p>

	</p>
	<p>Next is “<strong>Half Asleep/Half Awake</strong>” which is clearly about living a
		half-life, lost and not sure what to do with your life. While fun and catchy is one of my least favorite songs
		in the record.</p>
	<p>After that is “<strong>Punk Rock Messed You Up</strong>”, this being the first song
		I’ve heard from them. The title says a lot about the lyrics, it works as a conversation; I see the verses as
		society telling a kid about what “messed him up”’; things like parents, school but most of all that satanic
		punk-rock music. On the other side of the conversation are the verses, being a sarcastic or unaware response
		saying “I’m totally ok” (and I say sarcastic because the whole album is about being a bad place, not doing the
		things one wants, which is not exactly being ok). Aside from the very well handled lyrics as two sides of a
		conversation, the song also mixed that punk-rock screamed verses with nice clear vocals on the chorus giving
		some contrast on the song and leaving a clear separation between the two sides.</p>
	<p>So, like I said in the beginning, there’s Weezer vibes throughout the album, and
		“<strong>Never Clear My Room</strong>” is the clearest example. A very laid back rock song with only clean
		vocals with themes of someone knowing they are in a bad place (&#8220;<em>filled under lost</em>&#8220;) and
		telling everyone you might as well give up on them and “<em>save yourself the trouble</em>” because they’re
		hopeless. While the guitar may sound a little repetitive and monotone on the verses I think it does an excellent
		job on trapping you in the atmosphere. Also I love the chorus, I love songs that sound slow and fast at the same
		time.</p>

	<p>The next song is “<strong>It’s Hard to Make Friends</strong>”, while I liked it, is
		nothing too memorable but has a place in the album, being a nice bridge to “<strong>Kiss Me Hard</strong>”, a
		fun sounding song with a catchy chorus.</p>
	<p>Then comes “<strong>Faze Me</strong>”, the first song that sound like a left out of
		TRIH; and I don’t say it in a bad way since is a nice addition that prevents the album from sounding too poppy.
		It starts with that guitar feedback that was used, sometimes too much, in TRIH songs and has no clear vocals
		apart from that chorus on the end of the song. Lyrically is my favorite song in the album, it talks about
		half-assing everything and not taking risks. The chorus “<em>If it doesn’t scare you you’re not doing it right,
			if it doesn’t faze you you’re doing nothing at all</em>” summarizes the message of the song and the whole
		album perfect: take risks and leave your comfort zone, it may be scary but is always worth it.</p>
	<p>Again with the Weezer vibes we have two slow alternative songs: “<strong>Secrets
			Inside</strong>” and “<strong>Seen a Good Man (In a bad mood)</strong>”; the later having a dose of Nirvana
		in it, especially in the verses. While some may say the next track (“<strong>You’re Not Special</strong>”) is a
		filler song, I would strongly disagree; while it may not be a worthy song to listen to separate from the album,
		it works within it as a great transition and creates contrast to the next song, “<strong>Hoping for
			it</strong>”. Another THID sounding song with straight to the point, no bullshit lyrics; it talks about
		wanting to be something and doing nothing to get there but at the same time feeling frustration for not being
		able to just do it. This is, next to “Faze Me”, the heaviest the album gets.</p>
	<p>The next song is “<strong>Strange Way Down</strong>”. There’s no other song that
		sounds more “being done with life” than this; a slow bored sickening riff with a repetitive bass line which are
		complemented with a lazy singing voice. The only complain I have with this song is that I would have preferred
		if the dreamy slow sound would have continued through the whole song instead of having that heavy verse in the
		later part of the song, but still I love it and the atmosphere it creates, and when it comes back to that slow
		rhythm the lyrics complement the repetitive “boring” music perfectly (I say boring because it sound like they
		would rather be playing something else but is not boring, is just the feeling the song goes for).</p>
	<p>Last song in the album is “<strong>Rid Myself of You</strong>”, which continues with
		the mix of dreamy slow rock of the previous track. In my opinion, a perfect closing track for this album after
		switching between heavy and soft music. Apart from the music being a good closure, the lyrics talk about getting
		rid of “<em>the long dark blue</em>”; that meaning being sick and getting rid of the depression that the person
		behind all these songs feels.</p>
	<p>While this is not a happy album by any means I like the message of it quite a lot;
		try new things and don’t kick yourself in the teeth. It may not be the most radio friendly but I think there’s a
		lot of fun (ignoring the lyrics) and catchy songs. In my opinion there’s not a single track that feels out of
		place or overstays its welcome; all great quick songs that have a clear message and for what the band was trying
		to achieve I think is an easy 10/10 and easily one of my most played albums.</p>
	<p>If you liked this album, the band has stated on their FB page they were working on a
		new album so you have that to look forward to. Also check their bandcamp page and buy their album if you have
		the chance.</p>
