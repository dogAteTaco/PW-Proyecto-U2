	<h1>Making a Custom Kindle Dictionary</h1>
	<p>Making a Custom Kindle Dictionary isn&#8217;t very hard to do but while researching how to and doing a custom one
		I found a lot of small problems and incomplete or outdated info, so here is how I did it and the problems
		I&#8217;ve found while doing a Tolkien/English Dictionary. </p>


	<p>In this blog, I&#8217;m gonna explain to you how to construct the dictionary vocabulary, some problems I came
		across, how to do some formatting if you wanna be fancy about it and how to add and use the dictionary in your
		Kindle. We are going to make use of the Command Prompt, download a GitHub and run a Python script, if you
		aren&#8217;t familiar with them don&#8217;t worry since you only need to install some stuff and write very basic
		commands and I&#8217;ll explain them on the go. <br><br>This was made with the Kindle Firmware 5.14.3.0.1,
		Kindle Previewer 3.66.0, Tab2Opf Feb 3 2015, and Python 3.9.1, so if you find any differences comment and
		I&#8217;ll try to add them to this guide but since most of the info I&#8217;ve found online is pretty similar
		you shouldn&#8217;t have any problems</p>



	<h2>Why make a Custom Dictionary?</h2>
	<p>While I&#8217;m sure there are many applications for custom dictionaries, the one I found is a Fantasy Dictionary
		since many Fantasy books involve creatures, plants, places, people with many names, races, etc. To the point
		that it becomes a bit difficult to keep up, especially if you take long breaks between reading the series or
		book so I wanted to make a Tolkien universe dictionary for the fun of it and to help me remember who are the
		characters. Also since I&#8217;m going through Computer Engineering school I&#8217;m sure I already make custom
		books to help me study and I can see having a custom dictionary for computer terms being very useful.</p>



	<h2>Gathering the words for the dictionary </h2>



	<p>The simplest way to construct our dictionary will be using a tool called <a
			href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Tab2Opf</a>.</p>



	<p>This tool only requires one thing, a file with the word, followed by a Tab and then the definition. So you should
		have basically 2 columns, one for the words and then the definition. Note that the words being in alphabetic
		order is not important since Tab2Opf will organize them for us but if you are planning to use a lot of words it
		can be good to keep them organized yourself in case you wanna add more words later or be sure you aren&#8217;t
		missing any words.</p>



	<p>You can go about it in many ways. You could parse fan websites for the terms if you aren&#8217;t afraid to work a
		bit with HTML files, transcribe or copy from websites or books, or write your own definitions in Notepad or any
		text editor. </p>



	<p>Personally, I copied the definitions from David Day&#8217;s <em>A Dictionary for Tolkien</em> I got from Amazon
		and added the definitions from <em>The Online Plain Text English Dictionary</em> to not lose the English
		dictionary part since I&#8217;m not a native speaker and may want to look up some English words.</p>



	<p>At the end you should have something similar to this:</p>


	<div>
		<figure><a href="https://eriml.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/image-1.png"><img src="https://eriml.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/image-1.png?w=673" alt=""/></a></figure>
	</div>


	<h3>Things to be careful with</h3>



	<p>Make sure you always have 2 columns, I had some problems where one line had no word related to it. If you wanna
		use multiple lines for one word write it all on the same line but simply put an &lt;br&gt; HTML tag between the
		two lines, don&#8217;t use many lines for a single word. It may be hard to read but there&#8217;s no way around
		it.</p>



	<h3>Formatting</h3>



	<p>If you are going to use multiple definitions or lines for a word use the &lt;br&gt; tag like I said earlier but
		if you wanna be next level with it and you want to add some formatting like italic or bold to add notes like a
		real dictionary you can add italic by using the tag &lt;em&gt; and bold with &lt;strong&gt;, if you aren&#8217;t
		familiar with HTML tags you can do a quick google for it but it&#8217;s as simple as writing
		&lt;em&gt;word&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;word&lt;/strong&gt; and your word or lines will be in Italic or bold.
	</p>



	<p>If you are familiar with HTML and know the other ways to format bold and italic(&lt;b&gt; and &lt;i&gt;), do not
		use those since the dictionary won&#8217;t recognize them and will cause problems later on.</p>



	<p>Those are the formatting tags I think you&#8217;ll realistically need for a dictionary and the only ones
		I&#8217;ve tested, but you are free to experiment but know that testing a dictionary can be time-consuming since
		making the Kindle realize you made changes is a bit awkward and slow (I&#8217;ll explain it more later on).</p>



	<p></p>



	<h2>Getting Tab2Opf ready</h2>



	<p><strong>Tab2Opf</strong> is a Python script that will handle all the formatting for you and will create an OPF
		file so you can create the MOBI dictionary so you can use it on your Kindle. Python is a programming language
		that has become very common and it&#8217;s pretty easy to use. You only need to install it by going to this
		page: </p>



	<p><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">https://www.python.org/downloads/</a></p>



	<p>Download it and install it, it may ask you to restart your computer but should be ready to go after that. To make
		sure Python is installed correctly you can open a Command Prompt and type <strong><em>py &#8211;version</em>
		</strong>and it should print <em><strong>Python 3.9.1</strong></em> or whatever version you have installed. If
		it doesn&#8217;t, you can re-install or google how to fix it, it&#8217;s a simple fix but does require some
		explanation and I don&#8217;t want to add any more bloat to this post.</p>



	<p>Next, you&#8217;re gonna need to get Tab2Opf, which you can find on this Github page: <a
			href="https://github.com/apeyser/tab2opf">https://github.com/apeyser/tab2opf</a></p>



	<p>To download it simply press the Green button that says &#8220;Code&#8221; and use the last option &#8220;Download
		ZIP&#8221;. Extract that folder into whatever folder you want and you&#8217;re good to go.</p>



	<h2>Creating the OPF Dictionary</h2>



	<p>Now that you have your text file with the definitions and Python installed you need to open the Command Prompt on
		Windows. Copy the text file you created for the dictionary into the same folder you extracted Tab2Opf to so you
		have something like this:</p>


	<div>
		<figure><a href="https://eriml.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/image.png"><img src="https://eriml.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/image.png?w=634" alt=""/></a></figure>
	</div>


	<p>Next, you&#8217;ll need to navigate to the folder you extracted the Tab2Opf folder by typing &#8220;cd
		C:\Users\user\Documents\tab2opf-master&#8221;, of course replacing the folder location with whatever you chose.
		Once you&#8217;re in the correct folder you&#8217;ll need to type <em><strong>py tab2opf.py &#8220;Tolkien
				Dictionary.txt&#8221;</strong></em> by changing the name of your dictionary file. Note that the name you
		gave your file will be the name it shows on your Kindle and be sure to use quotations if your file has any
		spaces, otherwise they are not necessary. Next press Enter and you should see something like this:</p>


	<div>
		<figure><a href="https://eriml.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/image-2.png"><img src="https://eriml.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/image-2.png?w=702" alt=""/></a></figure>
	</div>


	<p><strong><em>If you don&#8217;t get this messaged and see error codes check the sections for problems I
				encountered and how I fixed them</em> </strong><em><strong>at the end of the post.</strong> </em></p>



	<p>You should see an OPF file in the same folder now next to multiple HTML files. The amount varies on how many
		words you added to the dictionary.</p>


	<div>
		<figure><a href="https://eriml.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/image-3.png"><img src="https://eriml.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/image-3.png?w=642" alt=""/></a></figure>
	</div>


	<h2>Creating the Kindle Dictionary</h2>



	<p>Now that you have the OPF file you are one step away from putting the dictionary on your Kindle. To convert the
		dictionary into a compatible format for Kindle you&#8217;ll need a software called <strong>Kindle
			Previewer</strong> that is meant to show authors and publishers how their eBooks will look like in the
		Kindle (the download link is lower on the page).</p>



	<p><a
			href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Previewer/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=21381691011">https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Previewer/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=21381691011</a>
	</p>



	<p>Install the program and open it and you should see something like this:</p>



	<figure><a href="https://eriml.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/image-4.png"><img src="https://eriml.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/image-4.png?w=1024" alt=""/></a></figure>



	<p>Now simply open the folder where you have the OPF file and drag it onto the program or do click on <em>File &gt;
			Open Book</em> and look for your OPF file. It will take a bit of time depending on the size of your
		dictionary so don&#8217;t get frustrated and will show you your dictionary like this:</p>



	<figure><a href="https://eriml.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/image-6.png"><img src="https://eriml.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/image-6.png?w=1024" alt=""/></a></figure>



	<p><strong><em>If you get any errors and it doesn&#8217;t show you your dictionary check the section at the
				end.</em></strong><br><br>Now simply go to <em>File</em> &gt; <em>Export</em> and be sure to select MOBI
		format on the dropdown and name the file whatever you want (this will not be the name the Kindle shows so if you
		have multiple versions of the dictionary you can add a number or date to it) like this:</p>


	<div>
		<figure><a href="https://eriml.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/image-7.png"><img 
					src="https://eriml.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/image-7.png?w=465" alt=""
					/></a></figure>
	</div>


	<p>Save the file in any location you want but remember it so later you can copy the dictionary on your Kindle, and
		you should be good to go. You created your Kindle dictionary.</p>



	<h2>Using the dictionary on your Kindle</h2>



	<p>The next step is the most simple. Connect your Kindle via USB to your computer and you should see a new drive on
		your File Explorer called Kindle. Open it and navigate to <em>documents</em> &gt; <em>dictionaries</em> and copy
		your MOBI dictionary into that folder. If the dictionaries folder doesn&#8217;t exist I think it means you
		haven&#8217;t downloaded any additional dictionaries so just create it and put your dictionary in there.</p>



	<p>Disconnect your Kindle from your computer and you&#8217;re good to go, you only need to select in your book your
		new dictionary.</p>



	<h2>Making changes, testing, or adding to your dictionary</h2>



	<p>If you want to add more words to your dictionary you have 2 options, adding it to your text file and making the
		whole process again (the one I think is easier and probably faster for most users). The other option is
		modifying the HTML file by copying the format of each word and adding more there but that will require you to
		know the structure and probably will take longer if you do it with multiple words.</p>



	<p>Once you have your new version you can simply replace the MOBI file in your Kindle and sometimes it will refresh
		with no problems. Other times you&#8217;ll find that is working with the old version and you will need to do one
		of two options, you can restart your Kindle but that&#8217;s a bit slower and if you are trying new stuff with
		formatting or having problems with some characters and so on that time will add up. The quicker option is
		plugging in your Kindle, deleting the dictionary, disconnecting the Kindle, try to use the dictionary so the
		Kindle realizes it&#8217;s no longer there, re-connect your Kindle, and copy it again. The second option is more
		steps and a bit tedious but is way faster than restarting the Kindle.</p>



	<h2>Problems I&#8217;ve encountered</h2>



	<p>Next, I will list all the problems I found and how I solved them. For some of them I found partial fixes and
		clues on various forums but I wanna compile and add to them here.</p>



	<h3>Problems when creating the OPF file</h3>



	<p>I came across this error while creating an English dictionary for testing</p>



	<figure>
		<a href="https://eriml.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/image-5.png">
		<img src="https://eriml.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/image-5.png?w=708" alt=""/>
		</a>
	</figure>



	<p>Turns out it was a poorly written line with no word for that definition and I solved it by adding the word, or
		you can simply delete the line, a similar error may be possible if you are using weird careful characters so
		keep an eye out for them.</p>



	<h3>Problems when creating the MOBI file</h3>



	<p>The thing I had most of the problems with was when I was creating the MOBI file. When I dragged the OPF file into
		Kindle Previewer I got the error &#8220;<em>Kindle Previewer could not preview this book due to a conversion
			failure. Please refer to the Conversion Log for more details&#8221;.</em></p>


	<div>
		<figure><a href="https://eriml.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/image-8.png"><img src="https://eriml.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/image-8.png?w=500" alt=""/></a></figure>
	</div>

	<p>If you click on the Conversion Log and get the error <em>E21016: Source file is not valid UTF8.</em> This happens
		because the formatting is incorrect and you need to convert it. There&#8217;s a simple fix. You need to download
		<em><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/">NotePad++</a></em> and open the HTML file listed on the
		error on NotePad++.</p>



	<p>Click <em>Encoding</em> on the menu inside NotePad++. There are two possible solutions. If you see <em>ANSI
		</em>marked (or anything different than UTF-8) with a circle on the left in the menu click on the option
		<em>Convert to UTF-8</em> and save the file. The other situation I encountered was that the file had
		<em>UTF-8</em> with a circle on the left, I fix that by first clicking on <em>ANSI</em> so the circle is now
		there and then click on <em>Convert to UTF-8</em> and save the file. </p>



	<h3>Problems with the dictionary on Kindle</h3>



	<p>While the Previewer may show you correct formatting there are some tags that work in the previewer but
		don&#8217;t work in the Kindle dictionary is already in use since the Previewer is meant for Books, not
		dictionaries. Two of the tags that cause issues are &lt;i&gt; and &lt;b&gt; like I mentioned earlier. This may
		cause some words to show multiple descriptions or incomplete paragraphs since the Kindle gets confused with the
		formatting. In my opinion, this is lazy programming by Amazon but luckily you can just use the alternative
		&lt;em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt; tags. If you encounter it with any other HTML tags try to find alternatives before
		you give up on that formatting you are looking for.</p>
