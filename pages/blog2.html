	<h1>Continuum by John Mayer – Favorite Albums</h1>
	<p>Like I said in my post about “Heavier Things” (John’s previous album), little me had no idea of what Blues was,
		mini-me only knew he liked a couple of songs from that album more than the rest but had no idea why. So, I get
		this album and it was like “Hey! You remember that stuff you really loved in the previous album and that song
		that made you think about the way you played guitar? How bout we give you a whole record with that but better?”.
		Before anything let me say I mostly hear the songs on this album from the live album “<strong>Where the light
			is” </strong>but I will advise to listen through this whole album first if you haven’t. So… let’s just start
		because is going to be a long one.</p>
	<p>So, before this album, the glorious John Mayer Trio was born; John Mayer, Steve Jordan (drums) and Pino Palladino
		(bass), and they made a blues album called “<strong>Try!</strong>” but that’s a different topic for another day,
		I just bring it up for some context for a part later on and so you understand these people had already worked
		together.</p>
	<p>The opening song wastes no time to show the kind of grooves they can make together. “<strong>Waiting on the World
			to Change</strong>” starts with my favorite thing about drums; ghost notes. Ghost notes sprinkled all over a
		catchy beat to prepare for the perfectly balance mix of blues and pop you are about to hear. A cut little riff
		with was seems a Xylphone and maybe piano mixed in is heard and then Mayer comes in, and right off the bat, his
		phrasing on the lyrics is bluesy af and even more, his guitar playing. Pino takes the background on this song
		but you can clearly hear his amazing fills every once in a while and feel the bass through the whole song. The
		lyrics get a political, a little cheesy? Yes, but you can see you’re in for a more mature album. Few first
		tracks can achieve what this song does; excellent production, sets the tone and is telling you you’re going to
		hear some amazing bass lines, drums and tasty blues licks.</p>
	<p>After that upbeat beginning we slow down into a bitter love song, “<strong>I Don’t Trust Myself (With Loving
			You)</strong>”. This song contains one my favorite guitar tones; a muffled dark sound that fits the
		aesthetic of the song perfectly. The lyrics are just masterfully written and delivered by John. The chorus comes
		in and very delicate backing vocals can be heard. Like the song before, we hear a good groove with the bass and
		drums but more laid back because of the song theme. While the solo is nothing out of this world, it does fit the
		song perfectly, nothing too crazy, just quiet, tender love from John’s fingers.</p>
	<p>Then the one that started it all for me, “<strong>Belief”</strong>. This, like the first track, starts with only
		drums to create the mood of the song. For me, the opening riff shows perfectly how a guitar and a bass
		complement each other, Palladino is playing only the root note twice per chord most of the time to give the
		guitar riff more power and is using fills to prevent the groove from getting too stale. While the guitar is not
		weak by itself, it is improved a ton by the bass. The lyrics are some of the best from John, he talks about
		religion and how everyone think they are right and nothing good can come from fighting over something so sacred
		and personal as someone’s belief; it might be silly at times but I think is a tasteful way to say “Everyone
		thinks differently, try to have an open mind”. The bridge parts of this song are some of my favorite moments on
		the album, you get a really sad and dreamy feeling from that guitar slide.</p>
	<p>The song has an abnormal structure for a pop song (Verse/Verse/Chorus/Bridge/Solo/Chorus/Outro), so after the
		first chorus we get a bridge to get more sense of the instrumentation before the solo. When the solo comes in,
		just the first 3 notes get me sold; there is just something in John’s guitar tone and rake technique that makes
		it sound like magic. Is one of the first solos I’ve learn and one I still play all the time, hoping I can make
		it sound perfect someday. After that we get into that dreamy chorus and just enjoy the instruments until they
		fade out; hearing how the bass completes the groove of the guitar perfectly.</p>
	<p>Now that I finally talked about JM song that means the most to me, let’s move into “<strong>Gravity</strong>”. A
		slow blues with amazing backing vocals and keyboard; this song lets you enjoy every little detail in the
		basslines, the drums, John’s singing, minimal licks from the guitar; there’s not a single dull moment in this
		song because there’s so many little things. Again, John fingers work their magic in one of my favorite lead
		riffs. As simple as they may be, both lyrics and music do so much with so little. Then the solo comes in,
		leaving a lot of empty space in between in order to preserve the slow blues feeling of the song. While I listen
		more to the live version of this song, I do prefer the mood the studio version creates because usually John goes
		crazy with the solo at the end.</p>
	<p>With “<strong>The Heart of Life</strong>” I get the opportunity to talk about something that is a signature about
		John’s playing, the Thumb Slap (he slaps his thumb at the strings as he plays). A technique that is practically
		cheating for creating a groovy rhythm, it automatically gives any chord progression life; is something I would
		advise any guitar player to practice, is hard to master and can give so much color to any folk/pop song. And
		about the song itself, well; is a simple song, groovy, calm and feels short because you just get into that thumb
		slap and hooky melody.</p>
	<p>Next I have a question; how many songs you know can use the same rhythm and guitar riff for 4 minutes straight
		and can feel fresh through it all? I would guess not so many, but that’s what “<strong>Vultures</strong>”
		achieves. I feel like this song was mostly recorded with Jordan, Palladino and Mayer just jamming and
		improvising for a while. I can totally see them just playing record and going with it because the groove is
		pretty dense here and nothing is too flashy about the song, is just simple enjoyable blues. The lyrics are
		pretty good, letting the 2006 narcissistic JM shine through it but I mean… he is John Mayer after all, you can’t
		blame him too much, just listen to those falsetto notes on the chorus.</p>
	<p>In contrast to the “Imma be the numba one” vibes from the previous track, “<strong>Stop this train</strong>”
		gives us a look into the fear lurking in John’s mind, the fear of things going too fast, that feeling of “oh…
		ok, so this is how real life is?”. From the innocent lyrics to the shy beautiful guitar, this song perfectly
		captures what fear of growing up is like. Again we hear that thumb slap but less aggressive. Like “Daughters” in
		the last album, this is almost just John and his guitar, aside from the bass, minimalistic snare with a brush
		and a couple of piano bars. This song contains maybe my favorite third verse of a song, it continues to build
		momentum and tension and you can hear the fear and sadness in Mayer’s voice to then get into the last chorus
		where the tone shifts a bit into a more defeated or resigned feeling made more clear by the change in the line
		“But honestly, would someone stop this train?” to “Now I see, I’m never going to stop this train”.</p>
	<p>Continuing with the cheerful, happy tone of the last song comes “<strong>Slow Dancing in a Burning
			Room</strong>”, a slow blues about being in a dying relationship and knowing it, how wonderful. And first of
		all, let me say I think is one of the cleverest lines/names of a song, is beautiful and sad at the same time.
		The opening is once again a carefully played subtle riff that combined with the harmony later on provides a sad
		and desperate feeling. When the chorus comes in and the backing vocals enter I get a feeling of going down a
		spiral and I strongly believe that was the intention because of the line “<em>we’re going down</em>”. In the
		lyrics and deliver you can see is not only sadness that he feels, is also a lot of anger and desperation. While
		I have not been in a relationship like that I can see how this can be very accurate, wanting to stay for those
		good moments (slow dancing) but being on the verge of chaos (the burning room).</p>
	<p>So this next one is a little hard for me to critic. Remember how in the previous post I said I didn’t know who
		Hendrix was before Mayer? So…. Yeah I heard this version of “<strong>Bold as Love</strong>” first. And I really
		liked it not knowing it was a cover. I remember thinking “hmm, those are some strange lyrics for John… who the
		heck is the Axis? Does she have a website with FAQs so I can ask her? This is way too cryptic for the mostly
		straight forward lyrics he has” and then after a while I heard the Jimi Hendrix Experience albums and I was like
		“oh… that explains everything”. &nbsp;That being said, at the beginning I thought the guitar was amazing, all
		the loud and quiet contrasts in the main chord progression; also the drums and bass top notch, no question about
		it.</p>
	<p>But then I heard the original version and how all over the place it was with the lines, how you can feel Hendrix
		that much into the song and just going crazy with the guitar at the end. And then I go and listen to John’s
		version and how well structure and how clean the phrasing is on the verses is and I can’t stop myself from
		feeling something was lost in transition, the soul from the song was ripped.</p>
	<p>Now… let me clarify, I’m not saying JM’s songs don’t have soul (I mean, go back a bit into this post and you’ll
		see) but I think the pop, clean aesthetic of John doesn’t fit at all with the “go with the flow, fuck it” vibe
		Hendrix had. This is even more clear in his cover of “Wait Until Tomorrow” cover in the Trio album. The original
		is some kind of dark comedy song about a guy wanting to escape with his girl and getting shot in the end by her
		dad, at some point Hendrix is basically saying “bitch, the fuck you talking about?” and facepalming. Also
		Hendrix does the lines whenever he feels like it in the chorus, and in contrast we have Mayer’s version that is
		played as a conventional song with the phrasing in the verse being straighten up and the chorus changed a bit so
		is more structured when it should be played and sung in a more playful manner. And that’s my John Mayer cover
		rant, let’s get to the next song.</p>
	<p>“<strong>Dreaming with a Broken Heart</strong>” is a sharp turn from the fast upbeat Hendrix cover. The lyrics,
		while simple are very well written and, as always, are enhanced by the vocal delivery. While I think the buildup
		into 2/3 of the song was a bit unnecessary, is a very good last concert song, which basically means I think this
		should have been the last song in the album but we’ll talk about that more when we get there.</p>
	<p>I don’t hate “<strong>In Repair</strong>”, I just don’t think there’s nothing new brought to the table. It
		actually feels like something from the last album reworked a little to fit onto this one.</p>
	<p><strong>&#8220;I&#8217;m Gonna Find Another</strong> <strong>You&#8221;.</strong> This last song is one of two
		things for me. The first: the last on the album that I think should have been the second-last song that should
		have been reworked a little to make more contrast to the song I would have loved the album to end on (Dreaming
		with a broken heart). The other is a creepy remainder of what’s coming next if you are listening to the 2008
		reissue of the album which contains the song “<strong>Say</strong>”, which I think is the worst song I’ve heard
		from Mayer, the lyrics are dumb and is annoying, at least other songs from him are dumb but have a nice sound.
		With all things considered I do like this song, is a little sassy and is a slow blues, which is good but I do
		feel like the song if far longer than it is, it somehow feels like it drags a little when is only 2:43. But like
		“Dreaming with a broken heart” I feel this is a good last song for concerts and still a decent song to end the
		record on.</p>
	<p>In summary, I do have problems with the album, a meh song and a cover I don’t like as much as I should. If we
		remove
		those 2 songs and rearrange the last 2 songs it would be and 12/10. But at the end I think those tracks do hurt
		the
		momentum the other songs built still I see them more like a little stain more than a big problem. Is an amazing
		album, awesome artists on it and a great chemistry between them; and is also what introduced me into blues so it
		gets bonus points for me. So is a 9/10.</p>
