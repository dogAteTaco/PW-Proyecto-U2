                <div class="linkcontent">
                    <p>Making a Custom Kindle Dictionary isn&#8217;t very hard to do but while researching how to and
                        doing a custom one
                        I found a lot of small problems and incomplete or outdated info, so here is how I did it and the
                        problems
                        I&#8217;ve found while doing a Tolkien/English Dictionary. </p>
                    <p>In this blog, I&#8217;m gonna explain to you how to construct the dictionary vocabulary, some
                        problems I came
                        across, how to do some formatting if you wanna be fancy about it and how to add and use the
                        dictionary in your
                        Kindle. We are going to make use of the Command Prompt, download a GitHub and run a Python
                        script, if you
                        aren&#8217;t familiar with them don&#8217;t worry since you only need to install some stuff and
                        write very basic
                        commands and I&#8217;ll explain them on the go. <br><br>This was made with the Kindle Firmware
                        5.14.3.0.1,
                        Kindle Previewer 3.66.0, Tab2Opf Feb 3 2015, and Python 3.9.1, so if you find any differences
                        comment and
                        I&#8217;ll try to add them to this guide but since most of the info I&#8217;ve found online is
                        pretty similar
                        you shouldn&#8217;t have any problems</p>

                <div class="linkcontent">
                    <p>Like I said in my post about “Heavier Things” (John’s previous album), little me had no idea of what Blues was,
                        mini-me only knew he liked a couple of songs from that album more than the rest but had no idea why. So, I get
                        this album and it was like “Hey! You remember that stuff you really loved in the previous album and that song
                        that made you think about the way you played guitar? How bout we give you a whole record with that but better?”.
                        Before anything let me say I mostly hear the songs on this album from the live album “<strong>Where the light
                            is” </strong>but I will advise to listen through this whole album first if you haven’t. So… let’s just start
                        because is going to be a long one.</p>
                    <p>So, before this album, the glorious John Mayer Trio was born; John Mayer, Steve Jordan (drums) and Pino Palladino
                        (bass), and they made a blues album called “<strong>Try!</strong>” but that’s a different topic for another day,
                        I just bring it up for some context for a part later on and so you understand these people had already worked
                        together.</p>

                <a href="pages/blog3.html">The Long Dark Blue by Swain – Favorite Albums</a>
                <div class="linkcontent">
                    <p><strong>Swain</strong> is a band I discovered through the magic of YouTube
                        recommendations. The band went with the name This Routine is Hell for years, but decided to change their name
                        along with their sound. TRIH was a hardcore punk-rock band but now they wanted to experiment with softer music
                        and different styles. While I do like the TRIH albums I do admit they could get a little repetitive like most
                        punk-rock bands so this experimenting was nice to see. So let&#8217;s talk about one of my favorite albums and
                        the the band&#8217;s first album as Swain, <strong>The Long Dark Blue</strong>.</p>
                    <p>As a whole, the album is about someone going through tough times, without a clear
                        mind of what they want to do and in a way being too stuck to do those anything to achieve their goals. Musically
                        speaking the style is a mix of good old grunge with some Weezer vibes on top of the hardcore punk style from
                        their previous work. While some of some songs on the album may be very different than others, the heavily
                        distorted guitar, thick bass tone and harsh vocals on the calmer songs make it blend pretty well with the harder
                        songs, and those mellow slow songs prevent it from getting too stale.</p>
                    <p>The album starts with “<strong>Hold My Head</strong>” and it doesn’t hold back
                        anything. It has catchy vocal melodies, trashy guitars, simple but groovy drums, intense screaming with a nice
                        background harmony; elements that will come back throughout the album. Like most of the other tracks, these
                        lyrics are almost straight with their meaning; this one in particular is about having a shitty day and looking
                        for some magic trick to fix this feeling. While short I think is my favorite track on the record just because it
                        does everything that is great in this album perfectly.</p>

                <p>Recently I’ve been trying to listen to books more actively and away from distractions so I often turn everything off, lights out and get the lyrics into my Kindle so I don’t have too much light and don’t get distracted by my phone or anything else.</p>
